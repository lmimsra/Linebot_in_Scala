## Akka
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaAkka#Configuration
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaAkka#Configuration
# ~~~~~
# Play uses Akka internally and exposes Akka Streams and actors in Websockets and
# other streaming HTTP responses.
akka {
  # "akka.log-config-on-start" is extraordinarly useful because it log the complete
  # configuration at INFO level, including defaults and overrides, so it s worth
  # putting at the very top.
  #
  # Put the following in your conf/logback.xml file:
  #
  # <logger name="akka.actor" level="INFO" />
  #
  # And then uncomment this line to debug the configuration.
  #
  #log-config-on-start = true
}

## Secret key
# http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ApplicationSecret
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to sign Play's session cookie.
# This must be changed for production, but we don't recommend you change it in this file.
play.crypto.secret = "1rEqb6zMaSA6J3n8]wnFH56LOn=UElCdN6oTZ^I0]REHvfw0Y^UgF/Tm:IuIULza"

## Modules
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Modules

# You can also extend Play functionality by using one of the publically available
# Play modules: https://playframework.com/documentation/latest/ModuleDirectory
play.modules {
  # By default, Play will load any class called Module that is defined
  # in the root package (the "app" directory), or you can define them
  # explicitly below.
  # If there are any built-in modules that you want to disable, you can list them here.
  #enabled += my.application.Module

  # If there are any built-in modules that you want to disable, you can list them here.
  #disabled += ""

## IDE
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/IDE
# ~~~~~
# Depending on your IDE, you can add a hyperlink for errors that will jump you
# directly to the code location in the IDE in dev mode. The following line makes 
# use of the IntelliJ IDEA REST interface: 
#play.editor="http://localhost:63342/api/file/?file=%s&line=%s"

## Internationalisation
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaI18N
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaI18N
# ~~~~~
# Play comes with its own i18n settings, which allow the user's preferred language
# to map through to internal messages, or allow the language to be stored in a cookie.
play.i18n {
  # The application languages
  langs = [ "jp" ]

  # Whether the language cookie should be secure or not

## WS (HTTP Client)
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaWS#Configuring-WS
# ~~~~~
# The HTTP client primarily used for REST APIs.  The default client can be
# configured directly, but you can also create different client instances
# with customized settings. You must enable this by adding to build.sbt:
#
# libraryDependencies += ws // or javaWs if using java
#
play.ws {
  # Sets HTTP requests not to follow 302 requests
  #followRedirects = false

  # Sets the maximum number of open HTTP connections for the client.

  ## Allowed hosts filter configuration
  hosts {
    # Allow requests to example.com, its subdomains, and localhost:9000.

## Database Connection Pool
# libraryDependencies += jdbc
#
play.db {
  # The combination of these two settings results in "db.default" as the
  # default JDBC pool:
  #config = "db"
  #default = "default"

  # Play uses HikariCP as the default connection pool.  You can override
  # settings by changing the prototype:
  prototype {
    # Sets a fixed JDBC connection pool size of 50
    #hikaricp.minimumIdle = 50
    #hikaricp.maximumPoolSize = 50
  }
}

#db {
  # You can declare as many datasources as you want.
  # By convention, the default datasource is named `default`

  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Developing-with-the-H2-Database
  #default.driver = org.h2.Driver
  #default.url = "jdbc:h2:mem:play"
